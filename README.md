# Phaser Task
 Phaser.js game coded with javascript

I started this project with no Javascript knowledge, so I had to transfer over my C# skills and to lots of web searches. It was quite fun to build. It is still not complete, but I decided to submit it anyway.

The spin works, but the win condition does not. My plan was to put the fruit orders into arrays and determine the result fruit based on the time of the spin, but I did not have the time to implement that. That was also going to make it possible to select proper fruits to lock, in cheat mode.

The problem that the spin currently has is; based on the length of random time, the spin tween tends to drift. The drift starts to be noticeable after the third or fourth spin. It increases as the "random interval" increases.

The project is not complete by any means, but I still wanted to put it out there. Thank you for taking the time to check it out :)
